## Stat testing, visualisation and dashboarding

- The House Price Index (HPI) dataset from gov.uk was examined.
- The trends in the regions of Great Britain were compared using a line graph.
- The 10-year trend in Britain was modelled and statistically analysed, and a dashboarded graph created.
- Boxplots were used to examine regional variation over this time - this was also dashboarded to allow realtime boxplot generation from selecting graph areas.
- Short-term trend differences between the groups were tested first for normality, then t-tested for difference between the groups.
- The outcome showed significant difference between the Wales and England trends, so this was visualised, dashboarded and discussed.
