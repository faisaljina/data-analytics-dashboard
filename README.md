# Stat testing, visualisation and dashboarding

The House Price Index (HPI) from gov.uk is a dataset used by many companies to track changes in the domestic housing market. This project uses R to examine the short- and long-term trends in this data, including the building of an RShiny dashboard.

### Features
- EDA
- Visualisation
- Hypothesis Testing
- Dashboarding

### Techniques
- Linear Regression Modelling
- Shapiro-Wilk Normality Testing
- Welch 2-Sample T-Testing
- RShiny

## Summary
1. The House Price Index (HPI) dataset from gov.uk was examined.
2. The trends in the regions of Great Britain were compared using a line graph.
3. The 10-year trend in Britain was modelled and statistically analysed, and a dashboarded graph created.
4. Boxplots were used to examine regional variation over this time - this was also dashboarded to allow realtime boxplot generation from selecting graph areas.
5. Short-term trend differences between the groups were tested first for normality, then t-tested for difference between the groups.
6. The outcome showed significant difference between the Wales and England trends, so this was visualised, dashboarded and discussed.
